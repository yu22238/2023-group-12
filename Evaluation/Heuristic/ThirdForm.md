# Heuristic Evaluation: Fireboy & Watergirl

As you play our game, please write down any usability problems that you encounter, the Nielsen Principle that it relates to, and any recommendations you may have to address the issue. 

| Issue | Heuristic | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keys are unclear | Consistency and standards | Change the keys to fit the standard gaming conventions. E.g. arrow keys, space to jump, WASD |
| It is not clear that diamonds need to be collected to complete a level | Help and documentation | Have a sentence to explain the aim of the game |
| Would forget which keys to use when switching between players | Recognition rather than recall | Add instructions to each level |
