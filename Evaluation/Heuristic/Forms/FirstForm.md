| Issue | Heuristic | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can not distinguish between player and enemies | Visibility of system status | Make the colour scheme more distinct |
| Not clear which keys to use | Help and documentation | Add instructions to make it clear which keys to use to move and how to shoot |
| Cannot press W&A at the same time | Error prevention | ? |
| The game glitched after releasing too many bullets | Error prevention | Need to deal with bullets off-screen, deleting them when they leave the screen |
